# easy-fishing
Makes so that every fish has the same difficulty to catch as a Grade 1 fish.

# Installation
For NA and EU add the files protocol.341697.map and protocol.341698.map to node_modules/tera-data/map. Or merge their contents if you already have custom opcodes.
If you want other regions, you will need to get the opcodes required for that region.

# Auto Fishing
If you wish to have the paid version, you can buy the nextgen easy-fishing that includes automatic fishing and soon will also include auto dismantling fishes and auto crafting bait for endless fishing. For more information you can add me on discord: KTC#9654
